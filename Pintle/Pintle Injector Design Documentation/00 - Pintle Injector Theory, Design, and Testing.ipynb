    "The Portland State Aerospace Society is in the process of testing its $2.2kN$ ($500 lb_f$) regeneratively cooled bi-propellant rocket motor. One of the critical steps prior to hot firing the motor is the testing and validating of the propellant injector. For this motor, a pintle style injector was selected and an aluminum test article was machined according to the designs provided by the 2015 Capstone team.  \n",

    "The 2015 engine was designed to employ a liquid oxygen (LOX) centered pintle design. In this design, LOX flows through the center of the pintle and is sprayed outward in a radial pattern. The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and enters the engine through the annular gap between the outer radius of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) Inside of the combustion chamber, the two propellants impinge upon each other at right angles. This, ideally, results in a cone shaped spray of well mixed fuel and oxidizer. \n",

    "\n",
    "The pintle injector serves two primary purposes in the engine. First, it delivers the fuel and the oxidizer to the combustion chamber at the correct mass flow rate and pressure. Secondly it mixes the propellants and promotes proper combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the mass flow rate through the injector is controlled by the input pressure for the fuel and oxidizer upstream of the injector. Ideally, the injector will have a pressure drop of between 15 and 25 % of the engine's chamber pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    ">This drop isolates chamber-pressure oscilations from the feed system, reducing pressure coupling between the combustion chamber and the feed system which could lead to instabilities or oscillations in the flow that are driven by various in combustion. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "For pintle injectors, this pressure drop can potentially go as low as 5% [1]. Until PSAS has built some heritage with our pintle designs, it is recommended that the 15-25% range be aimed for. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to some of the available research on pintle injectors, the optimum propellant spray angle is $45^\\circ$. [2]   \n",

    "\n",
    "The idea was that each flow path within the injector has multiple changes to flow area between point of measurement and the atmosphere. The early hand calculations in this project attempted to approximated the overall loss coefficient by segregating the internal flow geometry into segments which could examined individually for pressure losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of those pressure losses could then be added together to determine a total pressure drop estimate, $\\Delta P$. This $\\Delta P$ could then be used along with the mass flow rate to estimate a total $K_L$ for the injector. This showed early promise with the V2 injector and gave pressure drops which agreed with CFD models and physical testing. When attempts were made to scale up the injector design to meet the general requirements of an engine capable of reaching 100km, the errors in the estimate quickly diverged from CFD models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A note of caution, hand calculations and CFD should be employed during the design phase, but any injector which is to be used in an engine needs be specifically tested to determine its loss coefficients and spray angle performance. Small variations in hole sizes, even when within tolerance, can effect the actual performance of an injector. Theoretical models are valuable to steer the design into the right neighborhood, but still require physical testing for validation.\n",

    "This design met the flow rate requirements. It was not tested for spray angle because there was visibly uneven flow through the annulus. The cause of this was suspected to be flow separation in the fuel chamber which did not have adequate time to fully develop inside of the annulus. The solution to this was to split the flow into the fuel chamber into three, radially spaced flow paths.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The first attempt to explore an injector design within the approximate flow range of which may be needed by LV4 yielded interesting results. By interesting I mean frustrating and initially confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first attempt sought to scale up the V3 2.2kN injector on the naive assumption that the loss coefficients and exit velocities would scale in a predictable enough fashion to be able to roughly calculate the correct size based upon the physical testing and CFD results for the 2.2kN injectors. This assumption was incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, both the loss coefficients and the exit velocities did not behave as originally assumed.  This prompted a series of full factorial experiments using CFD, where key dimensions and parameters were systematically adjusted to isolate the key parameters which affect the loss coefficients for this design. The results of the experiments were then used to create a set of piecewise curve fit equations that can be used to obtain a good estimate of the loss coefficients for any size injector between the V1 2.2kN injector with approximately 0.2 kg/s total propellant mass flow rate, up to an injector with over 2.5 kg/s total propellant mass flow rate.\n",

However, the exit velocity of the fluid actually increased from 12 m/s to nearly 14 m/s. As can be seen in Figure 7, the modified design is does not seem to fix the flow separation issue. \n",

    "It could potentially work if you oversize the entrance holes and epoxy in threaded hardware. You will need to pay close attention to the dimensional accuracy.

This can pose an issue for trapped liquid in this type of resin printer. Careful designing would need to take place in order to get it to work, and all dimensions would need to be measured and verified, preferably with gauge pins and micrometers.\n",

    "The first major concern for the final version of an injector is material selection. The injector is going to be subjected to both liquid oxygen, high temperature combustion products, and several hundred PSI. The tip of the pintle is exposed to extreme heating which can potentially damage the pintle and make it a single use item. Thought should be put into how to either make the pintle tip easily replaced between tests, or how to keep it from getting too hot, preferably both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metal for the pintle needs to be LOX compatible: Generally this means 304 or 316 Stainless steel, with 304 having a slightly higher melting temperature. There are other material options as well such as Inconel (1390-1424$^\\circ$C), Nickel, Copper, or Nickel-Copper Alloys.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Aluminum is LOX compatible, but will not take the extreme heat which is expected on the pintle tip. (melting point ~ 660$^\\circ$C)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example it may be possible to 3D print the injector in Inconel. It would have its own manufacturing challenges when it comes to post processing, but it could potentially be done.\n"

    "## Purpose and Theory \n",
    "\n",
    "Once an injector design has been manufactured and checked to ensure all of the components fit properly, the first round of testing is performed with water.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Coefficients\n",
    "The first key deliverable from this test is to determine the loss coefficient for each propellant flow path through the injector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spray Angle \n",
    "The second deliverable is verification that the injector will create a 45$^\\circ$ spray pattern with acceptable mixing and droplet formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Momentum Ratio\n",
    "The third deliverable is determining if the injector meets the momentum ratio requirement for the propellant mass flow rates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressure transmitters\n",
    "    - Go for 0-100 psi transmitters for hydro testing. Anything higher will increase the error of the measurements.\n",
    "- Bucket and a stop watch\n",
    "- Load Cell capable of giving mass vs time data would be even better\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "- The full testing procedure should be its own document, this should be a rough summary. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert volume flow rate of water in gpm or liters/min to mass flow rate in kg/s \n",
    "- convert pressure from psi to pa\n",
    "- solve loss coefficient equation (7) using mass flow rate, pressure, density of water (measure the water temp, or estimate based on available data on typical tap water temp), and exit flow areas based on the measured as-built exit geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spray Angle \n",
    "\n",
    "- measure the angle, adjust the flow until you get a good 45 degree spray, then do full tests to determine what the pressure drops for each flow path which create that angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Momentum Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "- slightly more complicated to solve for, but with the pressure drops from the spray angle tests along with the loss coefficients from the loss coefficient tests, should be able to work out what the momentum ratio would be for actual propellants selected for engine design.\n",
